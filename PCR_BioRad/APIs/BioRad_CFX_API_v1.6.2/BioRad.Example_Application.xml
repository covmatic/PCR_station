            This class is part of the CFX Manager API Examples kit. 
            
            Implements demonstration application-layer logic using the CFXManagerClientWrapper class as 
            middleware to communicate with the CFX Manager API Service. Demonstrates the use of the
            most commonly utilized CFX Manager API operations and provides an example of how to use 
            instrument status polling to monitor and manage the operation of multiple instruments
            simultaneously.
            
            Performs CFX Manager version checking. If a compatible version of CFX Manager is running in 
            User Mode when the applications is started, it will establish a client connection with that
            instance of CFX Manager. If CFX Manager is not running when the application is started, it
            will start a Server Mode instance of CFX manager and establish a client connection with 
            that instance.
            
            Maintains a table of currently connected instruments and pertinent status metrics. Applies
            API operations to all currently selected instruments. Logs instrument operational status
            changes and operation status change interpretations to a TextBox console.

            can be expected to occur under anticipated circumstances in most applications, and should be ignored

            service is not running are ignored in order to allow the application to reconnect if CFX Manager

            which will unregister with the API service and allow other clients to connect to it. If
            the application started CFX Manager in server (No UI) mode, then issue the ShutDown command
            to properly close the CFX Manager instance. Not using ShutDown to close the CFX Manager
            could lead to ghost processes on the host computer which would would prevent the further use 
            of CFX Manager in any mode until host re-boot.
