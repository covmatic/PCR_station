# COVID-19 PCR Test Kits documentation

The documents in this folder describe the COVID-19 testing procedure. These documents are for 3 different test kits - AllPlex, KHB, and PrimerDesign.

All of these test kits are supported by the BioRad API v1.4. By default, the API assumes that the **KHB test kit** is used.

Refer to the documentation in the following link to understand about test kits:
